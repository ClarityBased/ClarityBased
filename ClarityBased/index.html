    <p>
      Sometimes growth doesn't look like progress.<br>
      It feels like stillness.<br>
      Like sitting with your thoughts, choosing not to run from discomfort.<br>
      You don’t need a morning routine or a 10-step plan.<br>
      You need honesty.<br>
      You need quiet.<br>
      And a small, private promise to try again tomorrow.<br>
      Real transformation isn’t loud — it’s subtle.<br>
      It shows up in the pause before you react,<br>
      in the way you speak to yourself when no one is listening.<br>
      Keep moving gently.<br>
      You’re not behind.<br>
      The path was never meant to be straight.<br>
      You’re learning.<br>
      You’re unlearning.<br>
      You’re becoming.
    </p>

    <p>
      Healing doesn’t always feel like healing. Sometimes it feels like being lost.<br>
      Like forgetting who you were, because you’re becoming someone new.<br>
      You may not see it, but you’re changing — not in a rush, not in flames, but in quiet rewiring.<br>
      You rest. You breathe. You pause. And in those small moments of grace,<br>
      you return to yourself again and again.<br>
      Growth isn’t linear. Some days are for reaching forward.<br>
      Others are for simply staying whole. Trust both. Trust the ebb and the rise.<br>
      You are not falling behind. You are evolving inward.
    </p>

    <h2>5 Tiny Habits That Quietly Change Your Life</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>🌱 Wake up just a little earlier</strong><br>
        Not to hustle. Just to sit with yourself. Breathe, sip something warm, let the day arrive slowly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>✏️ Write one honest sentence</strong><br>
        Doesn’t have to be wise. Just real. What you feel, what you notice, what you can’t say out loud.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>🚶‍♂️ Take a walk without noise</strong><br>
        No headphones. No scrolling. Just your feet, your breath, and the world as it is.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>🙅‍♀️ Say no to one thing</strong><br>
        Even a small no is a quiet yes to yourself.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>🙏 End your day with one thank you</strong><br>
        Not because life is perfect — but because you showed up. That counts.
      </li>
    </ul>
